					<h2 class="txt-color-blue">Dr. Jen Bright (Assistant Professor, Geosciences)</h2>
					<p>Jen Bright has a PhD in biomechanics from the University of Bristol, and an MGeol in Geological Sciences from the University
						of Leeds. Jen specialises in functional morphology, using a combination of geometric morphometrics and finite element
						modelling to investigate the relationship between the shape of animals’ skeletons and their mechanical performance.
						In particular, Jen is interested in how this relationship interacts with macroevolutionary and developmental processes,
						and how it changes through time. Most of Jen’s work has focused on the beaks and skulls of extant birds, a key component
						of which is the crowdsourcing morphometrics website, <a class="txt-color-blue" href="http://www.markmybird.org" target="_blank">markmybird.org</a>.
						This site is part of a European Research Council project at the University of Sheffield, UK, to investigate how beak
						shape evolved across the entire avian radiation. It ultimately aims to host a 3D surface scan of the beak of every
						bird species alive today, and also encourages the public to get involved with primary research by interacting with
						the scans and contributing vital landmark data to the project.</p>

					<p>Another central aspect of Jen’s research is determining the validity of biomechanical finite element models. By building
						skeletal models from regular and contrast enhanced CT scans and comparing these to ex vivo bone strain experiments,
						Jen has demonstrated both the potential and the limitations of finite element methods of animals known only from their
						fossil record. This allows greater confidence in our ability to understand the ecological role and behavior of extinct
						species, and permits detailed questions about the nature of faunal changes through time.

						Website: <a href="http://www.ryancarney.com" target="_blank">www.ryancarney.com</a></br>
						Email: ryancarney<i class="fa fa-at"></i>usf.edu
					</p>
					</br>
					<p>From <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to Zika, Dr. Ryan Carney’s multidisciplinary work primarily focuses on feathered dinosaurs
						and fighting diseases. This involves harnessing innovative technologies to 1) bring dinosaurs “back to life” by scientifically
						reconstructing skeletons, motion, and even original coloration, and 2), to predict epidemics of mosquito-borne viruses.
						Ryan also brings a diverse background and over a decade of leadership experience as Principal Investigator for various
						research projects around the world. By the time Ryan finished graduate school in 2016, his research had been cited
						over 500 times, published in <i>Nature</i>, and featured in <i>The New York Times</i> and popular science books. As
						a National Geographic Explorer, Ryan also enjoys sharing his fascination of the natural world through science outreach,
						including contributing to and consulting for museum exhibits, educational content, and television programs.</p>

					<p>Ryan graduated with Honors from UC Berkeley, with bachelor’s degrees in Integrative Biology and Art Practice. He then
						went on to lead a statewide disease surveillance program in California, intern at Google, and front a punk band on
						Warped Tour. Ryan also attended Yale University, where he received a Master of Public Health in epidemiology and an
						MBA in technology. There he was awarded the Dean’s Prize for Outstanding Thesis, for his work on a geospatial early
						warning system for dengue virus in Brazil. This disease modeling research built upon his prior work as Principal Investigator
						on an early warning system for West Nile virus. The latter results were so successful that CDC scientist Dr. Nicholas
						Komar called it “the best effort I’ve ever seen in predicting arboviral disease.” Currently, Ryan is leading this same
						research team to develop the predictive model into a free, open-source software solution to fight the spread of Zika
						virus in Florida, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and beyond (see
						<a href="{% url 'projects_project_index' project_name='zikast' %}" target="_blank">ZIKAST</a>).
					</p>

					<p>Ryan also received a PhD and MS in evolutionary biology from Brown University. His dissertation and current research
						focuses on the evolution of flying dinosaurs, with an emphasis on the iconic “missing link,” Archaeopteryx. This work
						integrates digital and experimental approaches, including X-ray imaging and computer animation of exceptional fossils
						and living animals. Ryan has also developed a novel joint surface approach for comparative analysis of skeletal evolution
						and motion. Ultimately, his research in “evolutionary biomechanics” aims to reveal the structural and functional changes
						that occurred during major locomotor transformations – how exactly did the walking dinosaur forelimb evolve into the
						modern bird wing? Many of these <a href="{% url 'projects_project_index' project_name='digital-dinosaurs' %}" target="_blank">results and technologies</a>						will be integrated into his spring 2017 course, “Digital Dinosaurs.” Future work will explore the use of next-generation
						3D platforms (virtual reality, interactive holograms) for research and teaching. Ryan also uses cutting-edge imaging
						and molecular techniques to reconstruct the original colors of fossilized feathers and skin. This work reveals not
						only what ancient creatures once looked like, it also provides insights into their evolutionary history and behavior.

						of Hellenistic naval power. He is currently a research associate with the Sicilian Egadi Island Survey Project, recovering
						ancient warship rams and other battle debris from the last naval battle of the First Punic War (241 BCE). Prof. Murray
						is working with others to apply 3D scanning and modeling techniques to these rams and to others to help visualize ancient
